# excel_YearlyReportMerge
Consolidating scattered data from multiple sheets (geographical difference) into a single organized sheet(YEARLY RECORDS) using Excel VBA Macros

First, the data is copied and pasted one-by-one from each sheets to the newly created sheet YEARLY REPORT. (It is made sure that the data from new sheet is not overwritten again as it loops through each sheet).
Then the headers are created and formatted in each of the sheets. (It is already created in the initial sheets by an earlier project)
Once that is done, a SUM function is included to automate the sum at the end of the totals column in each of the sheets.![SS](https://github.com/austin-a-i/excel_YearlyReportMerge/assets/125402322/17073b92-4297-4c02-a768-bf990d49cf59)
